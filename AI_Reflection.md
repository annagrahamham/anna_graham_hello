1) I used the Copilot extension in VSCode to help me. For the most part I didn’t really use it until I started adding things from Level 2 and 3. It was usually correct considering the prompts I gave it, but at first it obviously did not know some of the requirements for the assignment. For example, I had asked it to write code to use the scanner to input the name and age. It did this correctly however it got rid of the original HelloWorld method that required the constructor (String name, int age) in Level 2 so I had to add that back in. The biggest thing I used it for was the ASCII splash art for funsies. I also gave it each level requirement and asked it to check that I had done everything and draft a README.md file which it did.  

2) Prompt: “Can you make me ASCII Splash art of a cat?” 

Output: 

“Java does not support triple-quoted strings for multi-line output. You should use regular string concatenation with \n for new lines and double backslashes for the ASCII art. Here’s the correct way: 

System.out.println( 

      "  /\\_/\\  \n" 

    + " ( o.o )  CAT LAUNCHER\n" 

    + "  > ^ <  \n" 

);” 

This was not in fact the correct way and I changed some things but at least I didn’t have to make that cat myself. 

3) When asked to debug it said that there were no problems anywhere so theres not really anything to fix here as I also don’t see any problems.  

AI can definitely be useful but shouldn’t be fully relied on and instead should just be for suggestions and an extra pair of eyes.
